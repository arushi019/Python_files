Poverty and distress are a “breeding ground for disease, environmental degradation, internal conflict, and terrorism.
It has become clear that poverty means more than lack of income: it includes isolation and powerlessness, insecurity, 
lack of services, and lack of control over one’s future. It means spending hours every day gathering water and fuelwood, 
suffering from indoor pollution, facing domestic violence, being mistreated by police and government officials, and feeling 
constantly exposed to catastrophic risks—such as just one family member becoming ill.
Worldwide, close to 3 billion people—half the world's population—live on less than $2 a day. 
Everywhere, the worst affected are children, women, and old people.
This issue—fighting poverty in a major, definitive way—is truly global: it requires joint efforts by developed and 
developing countries. Not only is solving it the acid test for our ability to share our humanity, 
but it is also the test for how serious we are about solving global issues at large.
